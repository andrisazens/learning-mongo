1. Which of these statements is/are true?

Check all that apply:
You can index multiple array fields in a single document with a single compound index.
Covered queries can sometimes still require some of your documents to be examined.
Write concern has no impact on write latency.
Creating an ascending index on a monotonically increasing value creates index keys on the right-hand side of the index tree.
A collection scan has a logarithmic search time.

Which of the following statements is/are true?
Check all that apply:
Indexes can decrease insert throughput.
Partial indexes can be used to reduce the size requirements of the indexes.
It's important to ensure that secondaries with indexes that differ from the primary not be eligible to become primary.
Indexes can be walked backwards by inverting their keys in a sort predicate.
It's important to ensure that your shard key has high cardinality.

Which of the following statements is/are true?
Check all that apply:
MongoDB indexes are markov trees.
By default, all MongoDB user-created collections have an _id index.
Background index builds block all reads and writes to the database that holds the collection being indexed.
It's common practice to co-locate your mongos on the same machine as your application to reduce latency.
Collations can be used to create case insensitive indexes.

Which of the following statements is/are true?
Check all that apply:
Indexes can solve the problem of slow queries.
Indexes are fast to search because they're ordered such that you can find target values with few comparisons.
Under heavy write load you should scale your read throughput by reading from secondaries.
When you index on a field that is an array it creates a partial index.
On a sharded cluster, aggregation queries using $lookup will require a merge stage on a random shard.

Which of the following statements is/are true?
Check all that apply:
Compound indexes can service queries that filter on any subset of the index keys.
Compound indexes can service queries that filter on a prefix of the index keys.
If no indexes can be used then a collection scan will be necessary.
Query plans are evicted from the plan cache on index creation, destruction, or server restart.
By default, the explain() command will execute your query.

6. Which of the following statements is/are true?
Check all that apply:
An index doesn't become multikey until a document is inserted that has an array value.
Running performance tests from the mongo shell is an acceptable way to benchmark your database.
You can use the --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes option to place your indexes on a different disk than your data.
Indexes can only be traversed forward.
The ideal ratio between nReturned and totalKeysExamined is 1.

7. 
Given the following indexes:

{ categories: 1, price: 1 }
{ in_stock: 1, price: 1, name: 1 }
The following documents:

{ price: 2.99, name: "Soap", in_stock: true, categories: ['Beauty', 'Personal Care'] }
{ price: 7.99, name: "Knife", in_stock: false, categories: ['Outdoors'] }
And the following queries:

db.products.find({ in_stock: true, price: { $gt: 1, $lt: 5 } }).sort({ name: 1 })
db.products.find({ in_stock: true })
db.products.find({ categories: 'Beauty' }).sort({ price: 1 })
